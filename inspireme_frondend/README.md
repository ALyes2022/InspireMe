# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Sanity Client side configuration: client.js

# The createClient

function takes an object with your configuration, to make it work we need the following properties:

# projectId:

This is the unique identifier for your project that contains all your users, datasets, and other settings. It’s not secret as it’s part of the URL for your content APIs. You’ll find the project ID in the sanity.json file in your studio, or on the project page on sanity.io/manage.

# dataset:

This is a collection of documents within a project. You can have multiple datasets (for example: staging and production).

# apiVersion:

Usually you’d want to put in today’s date YYYY-MM-DD to get the newest version of the query API.

# useCdn:

If you set this to true the client will fetch content from our cache delivery network. In this case, however, we will not generate a whole lot of API traffic, and we want updates to be instantly available, so set this to false

# @sanity/image-url:

This helper will by default respect any crops/hotspots specified in the Sanity content provided to it. The most typical use case for this is to give it a sanity image and specify a width, height or both and get a nice, cropped and resized image according to the wishes of the content editor and the specifications of the front end developer.

In addition to the core use case, this library provides a handy builder to access the rich selection of processing options available in the Sanity image pipeline.
